welp took it down a while back after the codebase got to messy to work on, ay man it was the first web thing i made so i feel like that's a decent enough excuse :D
at least it had its year of fame

It was also my first experience with ui design so it wasn't a complete waste yay

Ended up looking very different from my design and kinda devolved into a css animation playground 😁
